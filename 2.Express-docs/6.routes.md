# Routes
Routes in web development define how an application responds to different requests from clients. They specify what should happen when a user visits a particular URL or endpoint. For example, when a user goes to `/home`, the route for `/home` will determine what content or data to send back.

### Key Points:
- **Endpoints**: Specific URLs that users can visit, like `/home` or 

users

.
- **HTTP Methods**: Different types of requests, such as `GET` (to retrieve data), `POST` (to send data), `PUT` (to update data), and `DELETE` (to remove data).
- **Route Handlers**: Functions that run when a specific endpoint is accessed, determining what response to send back.

### Example:
In an Express.js application:
```javascript
app.get('/home', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Welcome to the home page!');
});

app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
    // Code to create a new user
    res.send('User created!');
});
```
- `app.get('/home', ...)`: Handles `GET` requests to `/home` and sends back a welcome message.
- `app.post('/users', ...)`: Handles `POST` requests to 

users

 and sends back a confirmation message.

In simple terms, routes tell your application what to do when users visit different URLs.
