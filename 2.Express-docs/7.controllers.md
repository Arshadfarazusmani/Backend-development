# controllers 

In web development, particularly in the context of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, controllers are responsible for handling the logic of incoming requests, processing data, and returning the appropriate responses. They act as an intermediary between the model (data) and the view (user interface).

### Key Points:
1. **Request Handling**:
   - Controllers receive incoming HTTP requests from the client.
   - They determine what action to take based on the request.

2. **Business Logic**:
   - Controllers contain the business logic needed to process the request.
   - They may interact with the model to retrieve, update, or delete data.

3. **Response Generation**:
   - After processing the request, controllers send back the appropriate response to the client.
   - This could be rendering a view, sending JSON data, or redirecting to another route.

### Example in Express.js:
Here's an example of a simple controller in an Express.js application:

```javascript
// userController.js

import User from './models/user.js'; // Import the User model

// Controller function to get all users
export const getAllUsers = async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const users = await User.find(); // Retrieve all users from the database
        res.json(users); // Send the users as a JSON response
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error retrieving users' });
    }
};

// Controller function to create a new user
export const createUser = async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const newUser = new User(req.body); // Create a new user with the request body data
        await newUser.save(); // Save the new user to the database
        res.status(201).json(newUser); // Send the created user as a JSON response
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(400).json({ message: 'Error creating user' });
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
- **getAllUsers**:
  - Handles requests to retrieve all users.
  - Interacts with the `User` model to fetch data from the database.
  - Sends the data back as a JSON response.

- **createUser**:
  - Handles requests to create a new user.
  - Uses the `User` model to save the new user to the database.
  - Sends the created user back as a JSON response.

### Summary:
Controllers in web development manage the logic for handling incoming requests, processing data, and returning responses. They serve as the bridge between the model (data) and the view (user interface), ensuring that the application functions correctly and efficiently.
