# Backend Dvelopment guide 
Backend development, also known as server-side development, refers to the creation and management of the technology and logic that powers the functionality of web and mobile applications behind the scenes. It focuses on data processing, business logic, and the interaction between the frontend (user-facing interface) and the server/databases.



Backend development is the engine that powers applications, ensuring they are functional, secure, and scalable. A backend developer is responsible for handling the data flow, logic, and performance of the application while ensuring it seamlessly integrates with the frontend. Mastering backend development requires a strong understanding of programming, databases, APIs, and system architecture.
