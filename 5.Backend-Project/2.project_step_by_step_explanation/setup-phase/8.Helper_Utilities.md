## 1. Async handler function 

You will design a lot of get requests,
lots of post requests, and there are potential
chances that that request might fail.

In those failure cases, you want to wrap up
all of your requests into a try catch block.

Now imagine writing try catch blocks so many times
in every single controller that you'll be writing.
Yeah, that's not easy, and that's also not a great piece
of code, really not that easy to understand as well.

And there are also potentials that some of
the requests might be asynchronous, and in that
how you're handling these asynchronous requests.

```js
const asyncHandler=(requestHandler)=>{
    return (res,req,next)=>{
         Promise.resolve(requestHandler(req, res, next)).catch((err) =>{ 
            next(err)
            });
    
    }
}

```

### Breakdown:

#### 1. Function Definition:

```js
const asyncHandler= (requestHandler)=>{}
```

- Defines an asyncHandler function that takes a requestHandler as an argument. The requestHandler is expected to be an asynchronous function (e.g., an async route handler).

#### 2. Returning a Middleware Function:
```JavaScript 
return (req, res, next) => {
    }
 ```

The asyncHandler function returns a new middleware function that takes req, res, and next as arguments. This returned function will be used as the actual route handler.

#### 3. Handling the Asynchronous Code:
```js
Promise.resolve(requestHandler(req, res, next)).catch((err) => next(err));
```
Promise.resolve(requestHandler(req, res, next)): This line ensures that the requestHandler function is executed and its result is wrapped in a resolved promise. If the requestHandler is an async function, it will return a promise.


.catch((err) => next(err)): If the promise is rejected (i.e., an error occurs in the requestHandler), the error is caught and passed to the next middleware function using next(err). This allows Express to handle the error appropriately, typically by passing it to an error-handling middleware.


#### 4. Exporting the asyncHandler:
```js
export { asyncHandler };

```
The asyncHandler function is exported so that it can be imported and used in other files.

### Purpose:
Error Handling: The asyncHandler function simplifies error handling in asynchronous route handlers by automatically catching errors and passing them to the next middleware. This prevents the need to wrap each async route handler in a try-catch block.


Code Cleanliness: Using asyncHandler helps keep route handler code clean and concise by abstracting the error-handling logic.

### Example Usage:
Here's an example of how you might use asyncHandler in an Express route:
```js
import express from 'express';
import { asyncHandler } from './utils/async-handler.js';

const app = express();

app.get('/data', asyncHandler(async (req, res, next) => {
    const data = await fetchDataFromDatabase(); // Assume this is an async function
    res.json(data);
}));

app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.error(err);
    res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});

```


In this example, the asyncHandler is used to wrap an async route handler, ensuring that any errors are caught and passed to the error-handling middleware.

In summary, the asyncHandler function is a utility that helps manage errors in asynchronous route handlers by catching any errors and passing them to the next middleware function, keeping the code clean and maintainable.
