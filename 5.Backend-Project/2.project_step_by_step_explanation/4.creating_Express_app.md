# Creating Express Application 
we will create express app inside new file app.js inside source directory 

The provided code snippet is setting up a basic Express application and exporting it for use in other parts of the project. Here's a detailed explanation of each part:
```js
import express from "express"; // import express module to create express application
const app = express(); // create an instance of an Express application

export { app }; // export the app instance

```

 ### Key Features of an Express App:

#### Middleware:

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.

Middleware can execute code, modify the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, and call the next middleware function.

#### Routing:

An Express app provides a robust routing mechanism to define routes for different HTTP methods and URLs.

Routes are defined using methods like app.get(), app.post(), app.put(), app.delete(), etc

#### Configuration:

An Express app can be configured with various settings and options using methods like app.set() and app.get().


#### Error Handling:

An Express app can define error-handling middleware to manage errors that occur during the request-response cycle.

#### Templating:

An Express app can be configured to use templating engines like Pug, EJS, etc., to render dynamic HTML pages.
